# UFOs
## Overview of the Project
The purpose of the analysis was to create a website that displays a table of UFO sigthings in North America. Included was also an article talking about UFOs and a filter that can be used to search through the table of data. The data comes from a file called data.js that contains an array with the keys of the sightings (datetime, city, state, country, shape, durationMinutes and comments). Then a Javascript file app.js uses the input from the user to sort through the data and create an output on the website.
## Results
When using the webpage there are five seperate filters that can be used to narrow down your search those being:

Lets search by state for this exapmple I will search by tx:
![tx search](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110861876/197883104-074a123b-f30f-4488-b958-b801640ac969.png)
As you can see all that shows on the table is from the state of Texas.
## Summary
One drawback of the webpage is that there is no link to the data or to where we got the information for the article for the user if they wanted access to it.

Two further developmental recomendations are:
- Add another filter group to be able to compare seperate filter searches faster.
- Add links to the data and article information.
